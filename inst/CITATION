abstract="Simulation of genetic variants data is frequently required for the evaluation of statistical methods in the fields of human and animal genetics. Although a number of high-quality genetic simulators have been developed, many of them require advanced knowledge in population genetics or in computation to be used effectively. In addition, generating simulated data in the context of family-based studies demands sophisticated methods and advanced computer programming.",
